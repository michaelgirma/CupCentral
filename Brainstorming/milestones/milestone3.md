## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were easily able to setup the repo to work with each other on the project. By having an issues list setup we can assign and check off small issues as we complete them.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

There were a few challenges with getting the dev branch to merge with the main branch.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We were not entierly able to finish all of the tasks we had planned for this week. We plan on prioritizing the main features bit by bit and then working on the smaller features.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Some of the beginner bits such as the backend and user authentication are at risk. We plan on working on these features as soon as possible so we can have a stable and working platform for the other features.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I think some help with setting up user authentication and dealing with user interactions might be helpful for implementing some of our ideas.
